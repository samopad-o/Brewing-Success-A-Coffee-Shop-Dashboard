# Brewing-Success-A-Coffee-Shop-Dashboard
An interactive dashboard that transforms a raw coffee shop dataset into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decisions for optimizing sales strategy and boosting profitability. Built with Microsoft Excel.
## Introduction
Ever wondered what goes into making your favorite coffee shop tick, beyond the perfectly frothed milk and expertly pulled espresso shot? The truth is, behind every successful cup, there’s often a rich brew of data. As a passionate data enthusiast, I recently embarked on a project to dissect the sales performance of a hypothetical coffee shop(Maven Roasters: Coffee Shop Sales & Revenue Data), transforming raw figures into actionable insights through a dynamic dashboard. In this post, I’ll walk you through my journey of building this dashboard, showcasing how data visualization can illuminate key trends, identify top-performing products, and ultimately, help a business serve its customers even better.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains comprehensive Maven Roasters: Coffee sales records across various stores, product type, and product category. Key fields include:
* Transaction id: Numeric Unique identifier for each transaction.
* Month: The month when the transaction occurred
* Day: The day of the week when the transaction was made
* Hour category: The class of time when the transaction was made (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
* Transaction date: Date when the transaction occurred
* Transaction time: Time of the transaction
* Transaction qty: Numeric Quantity of products purchased in a transaction.
* Store location: Name or description of the store’s physical location.
* Unit price: Numeric Price of a single unit of the product in the transaction.
* Product category: General category to which the product belongs (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Drinking Chocolate).
* Product type: Specific type or variant of the product (e.g., Gourmet brewed coffee, Brewed Chai tea, Hot chocolate).
* Revenue: the income generated from the transaction. i.e unit price*transaction qty.
## Dataset Source
This dataset was originally sourced from Kaggle's Maven Roasters: Coffee Shop Sales & Revenue Data. It contains the fictious coffee shop sales data for the year 2023. It is meant for educational purposes only.
## Objective
My main goal was to transform raw sales data into an interactive dashboard, providing a clear view of the coffee shop’s performance. The project focused on three key areas: analyzing sales trends over time, which days of the week tend to be the busiest, and evaluating product popularity and profitability. Ultimately, the objective was to create a user-friendly tool that empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and boost revenue.
Key tasks involved:
* **Data Cleaning**
* **Feature Engineering**
* **Interactive Dashboards**
* **Consistent Formatting & Branding**
## Data Cleaning
Before visualizing the data, I performed the following crucial cleaning steps in Excel:
* Converted the dataset into a Excel Table.
* Removed all empty rows and columns.
* Checked for, and handled missing values using filters.
* Identified and addressed duplicate entries.
* Created few new insightful columns such as revenue, hour category, months e.t.c.
* Applied consistent formatting (e.g., currency for sales figures, general text for categorical fields).
## Dashboard Overview
I built a fully interactive Excel dashboard, combining all the charts into a single, cohesive view. Key features of the dashboard include:
* Clean Layout with consistent margins and spacing.
* Clear Typography and precise design alignment for enhanced readability.
* Harmonized Background Color & Branding.
* Integrated Slicer for dynamic filtering by various dimensions.

## Tools Used
* Microsoft Excel: Utilized extensively for Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Dashboard creation.
* Adobe Color: Employed for selecting a brand-consistent color theme.
## Files Included
* [[Maven: Coffee Shop Sales & Revenue Analysis Dataset(2023)](https://github.com/samopad-o/Brewing-Success-A-Coffee-Shop-Dashboard/blob/main/Maven%20Coffee%20Shop%20Sales.xlsx)
## Insights
The dashboard provided several key insights:
* Coffee leads in revenue, surpassing $89000, making it Maven’s highest-performing category. Conversely, Flavors lags behind, with the lowest revenue figures.
* June records the highest monthly revenue at over $110,000 — likely influenced by being a transitional month, marking the start of summer and warmer weather for many parts of the world. February shows the lowest sales, likely influenced by severe weather which can deter customers from leaving their homes. Heavy snow or extreme cold can lead to fewer commuters, fewer people running errands, and generally lower foot traffic for the entire month.
* Customers buy most in the morning maybe due to the morning rush which is directly tied to the flow of traffic and people heading to work or school. Customers stop at a coffee shop on their way to the office, a classroom, or a construction site. This makes the morning a captive market for people who need a quick, convenient source of energy before they begin their tasks.
## What I Learned
This project was a significant learning experience, allowing me to master:
* How to effectively clean and structure messy raw data for analysis.
* The power of slicers to create dynamic and interactive reporting.
* The principles of designing clean dashboards with consistent formatting and strong visual communication.
* That Excel can be a powerful and enjoyable tool for data analysis and visualization once its capabilities are fully explored.
